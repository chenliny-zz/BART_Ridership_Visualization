# Data Engineering Playground with BART Ridership Data 

**For better viewing experience, please see the project on [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chenliny/DataEngineering_Playground/blob/master/bart_with_sparksql/BART_Ridership_Spark.ipynb)**

The **bart_with_sparksql** folder contains a mini playground project using Spark DataFrames with BART ridership data from 2015 to 2018. Benefits of running Spark on a single node with a small dataset (40 million records in this case) are limited, but it was a fun way to get to learn Spark DataFrame basics for a Spark newbie like myself.
